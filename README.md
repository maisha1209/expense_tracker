Expense Tracker – Organize Your Finances More Intellectually

📖 Description
Expense Tracker is a web app built using Django to help graduate students and anyone who has been through the hustle of financial constraints. The goal of the application is to make expense tracking simple, budgeting easier, and goal-based saving achievable. All these will empower users toward financial stability, saving effectively, and working towards entrepreneurial ventures or personal financial goals.

🚀 Features
Expense Tracker: Fetch and show all transaction details and real-time account balances by integrating Plaid API.
Savings Goals: Set and track savings goals, such as saving $5,000 in 6 months, with automated progress updates.
Budget Insights: Identify spending patterns and suggest ways to reduce unnecessary expenses.
Account Integration: Link bank accounts securely to view detailed account summaries and transactions.
Intuitive UI: User-friendly interface, responsive design, developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
PostgreSQL Database: Reliable and safe storage for users' data, transactions, and saving goals.

🎯 Motivation
The Expense Tracker project was specifically designed for graduate students entering the workforce. Immediately after school, most graduates face financial constraints: low income coupled with increasing expenses. This tool will help them understand their spending habits and make informed financial decisions about saving for big goals, such as starting a business or tackling student loans. It's meant to empower users to take charge of their finances and improve financial literacy.
